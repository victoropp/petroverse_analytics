# PetroVerse Analytics Platform - Dashboard Architecture
## World-Class Dashboard Specifications

### UNDERSTANDING CONFIRMATION
✅ **I understand that:**
- BDCs supply to OMCs (wholesale → retail flow)
- No double counting (BDC and OMC volumes are separate stages)
- Use only actual data from database (no synthetic data)
- Each dashboard must have global filters affecting all charts
- Multiple focused dashboards to avoid clutter
- World-class UX/UI for petroleum industry analytics
