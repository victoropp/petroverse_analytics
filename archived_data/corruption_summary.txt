DATABASE CORRUPTION ANALYSIS & CLEANING PROPOSAL
=======================================================

CURRENT CORRUPTION STATUS:
- Should have: 248 OMC companies + 88 BDC companies = 336 total
- Actually has: 21 OMC companies + 23 BDC companies = 44 total  
- LOST: 292 companies (87% data loss!)

MAJOR ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
1. Aggressive fuzzy matching collapsed many different companies into single names
2. Examples of wrong mappings from log:
   - 'AI ENERGY GROUP LIMITED' -> 'ABAGURUGU OIL Co Ltd' (COMPLETELY WRONG!)
   - 'ALIVE GAS' -> 'AEGIS HUILE Co Ltd' (COMPLETELY WRONG!)
   - 'ASPEN PETROLEUM' -> 'ABAGURUGU OIL Co Ltd' (COMPLETELY WRONG!)

CORRUPTION EXAMPLES:
- 'ABAGURUGU OIL Co Ltd' now has 207,508 records (clearly from multiple companies)
- 'AEGIS HUILE Co Ltd' has 70,843 records (probably from 10+ different companies)
- This is catastrophic data corruption!

PROPOSED SOLUTION:
===================

STEP 1: COMPLETE DATABASE CLEANUP
- DELETE all data from omc_data table
- DELETE all data from bdc_data table  
- DELETE all data from companies table
- This will remove all corrupted mappings

STEP 2: PROPER COMPANY STANDARDIZATION
Instead of aggressive fuzzy matching, use intelligent standardization:

OMC COMPANIES (248 -> ~200 after cleaning):
- Remove obvious junk entries (***ADINKRA, etc.)
- Standardize common variations:
  * "AI ENERGY GROUP LIMITED" + "AI ENERGY & PETROLEUM" -> "AI ENERGY GROUP"
  * "ALIVE GAS" + "ALIVE GAS SERVICE LIMITED" -> "ALIVE GAS SERVICE"
  * "AGAPET LIMITED" -> "AGAPET"
- Keep most companies as unique entities

BDC COMPANIES (88 -> ~70 after cleaning):
- Standardize obvious duplicates:
  * "AKWAABA LINK" + "AKWABA LINK" + "AKWAABA LINK INVESTMENTS LIMITED" -> "AKWAABA LINK GROUP"
  * "BLUE OCEAN INVESTMENTS" + "BLUE OCEAN ENERGY" -> "BLUE OCEAN GROUP" 
  * "PETROLEUM WAREHOUSING & SUPPLY" variations -> "PETROLEUM WAREHOUSING & SUPPLY"

STEP 3: PRODUCT STANDARDIZATION (KEEP CURRENT)
- Gasoline, Gasoil, LPG, etc. (current 8 products are correct)

EXPECTED FINAL RESULTS:
- OMC Companies: ~200 (instead of current 21)
- BDC Companies: ~70 (instead of current 23)  
- Total: ~270 companies (instead of current 44)
- All records properly attributed to correct companies

RECOMMENDATION:
===============
1. APPROVE this cleaning approach?
2. Should I proceed with complete database cleanup and proper re-import?
3. Any specific company name standards you want me to follow?

CRITICAL: The current database is severely corrupted and needs complete cleanup!
