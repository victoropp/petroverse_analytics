# Quality Score Statistical Analysis

## Overview
The quality score is a metric used across the Petroverse Analytics platform to assess data quality and reliability. Based on the database analysis, here are the key findings:

## Current Quality Score Statistics

### Supply Data
- **Average Score**: 1.00 (100%)
- **Min Score**: 1.00
- **Max Score**: 1.00
- **Standard Deviation**: 0.00
- **Total Records**: 3,036
- **Distribution**:
  - High Quality (≥0.95): 100% (3,036 records)
  - Medium Quality (0.80-0.95): 0%
  - Low Quality (<0.80): 0%

### BDC Data
- **Average Score**: 0.957 (95.7%)
- **Min Score**: 0.70
- **Max Score**: 1.00
- **Standard Deviation**: 0.104
- **Total Records**: 8,475
- **Coefficient of Variation**: 10.9%

### OMC Data
- **Average Score**: 0.998 (99.8%)
- **Min Score**: 0.80
- **Max Score**: 1.00
- **Standard Deviation**: 0.020
- **Total Records**: 24,314
- **Coefficient of Variation**: 2.0%

## Statistical Accuracy Analysis

### 1. **Perfect Scores in Supply Data**
- All supply data records have a quality score of 1.00
- Zero variance indicates either:
  - Exceptionally clean and validated source data
  - Simplified quality calculation methodology
  - Default value assignment during ETL

### 2. **BDC Data Quality Distribution**
- Shows realistic variation with 10.4% standard deviation
- 95.7% average indicates generally high-quality data
- Presence of scores as low as 0.70 suggests active quality assessment
- Normal distribution characteristics with meaningful variance

### 3. **OMC Data Quality Distribution**
- Very high average (99.8%) with minimal variation (2% CV)
- Tighter quality control than BDC data
- Minimum score of 0.80 indicates quality threshold enforcement

## Quality Score Components (Inferred)

Based on the database schema and analytics code, quality scores likely consider:
1. **Data Completeness**: Presence of required fields
2. **Data Consistency**: Logical consistency checks
3. **Outlier Detection**: Statistical outlier flagging
4. **Temporal Consistency**: Time-series validation
5. **Cross-reference Validation**: Matching against reference data

## Statistical Reliability

### Confidence Intervals (95% CI)
- **Supply Data**: 1.00 ± 0.00 (No variation)
- **BDC Data**: 0.957 ± 0.002 (Very tight CI due to large sample)
- **OMC Data**: 0.998 ± 0.0003 (Extremely tight CI)

### Statistical Power
- Large sample sizes (3,036 to 24,314 records) provide high statistical power
- Estimates are highly reliable for population-level inferences
- Standard errors are negligible due to sample size

## Recommendations for Improvement

### 1. **Supply Data Quality Assessment**
- Implement more granular quality scoring methodology
- Add variance to capture data quality nuances
- Consider factors like:
  - Timeliness of data submission
  - Source reliability ratings
  - Cross-validation with other sources

### 2. **Quality Score Calibration**
- Establish clear quality score bands:
  - 0.95-1.00: Excellent
  - 0.85-0.95: Good
  - 0.75-0.85: Fair
  - Below 0.75: Needs Review

### 3. **Statistical Monitoring**
- Implement control charts for quality scores
- Set up alerts for quality score degradation
- Track quality trends over time

### 4. **Validation Framework**
- Document quality score calculation methodology
- Implement automated quality checks
- Regular audits of quality scoring accuracy

## Conclusion

The quality scores show high statistical reliability with:
- **Supply Data**: Perfect scores (needs review of methodology)
- **BDC Data**: Realistic distribution with 95.7% average
- **OMC Data**: Very high quality with 99.8% average

The large sample sizes ensure statistical accuracy within ±0.2% at 95% confidence level. However, the perfect scores in supply data suggest the quality assessment methodology could be enhanced for more granular insights.
