## Conclusions

### 1. No Corrections Were Made
Despite the filename suggesting "CORRECTED" and "UPDATED", the files in the `correct final` directory are identical to the regular final files. This could mean:
- The corrections were already applied to the regular files
- The files were duplicated for backup purposes
- No corrections were actually needed

### 2. Database Is Accurate
The PostgreSQL database on port 5432 contains:
- **Exact copy** of all data from both file versions
- **No data loss** or corruption
- **All metrics preserved** accurately

### 3. Data Consistency Confirmed
- All three sources (correct final, regular final, database) are **100% synchronized**
- The 734 duplicate records exist consistently across all sources
- Data quality scores and outlier flags are preserved

## Recommendations

### 1. File Management
Since the "correct final" files are identical to the regular files:
- Consider removing redundant copies to save space
- Or clearly document that they are backups, not corrections

### 2. Database Usage
- **Use the database** as the primary data source
- It provides better performance and data integrity
- The database accurately represents all file versions

### 3. Duplicate Resolution
The 734 duplicate records (564 BDC + 170 OMC) remain unresolved:
- These appear to be unit conversion errors
- Consider creating a cleaned dataset in the future
- Document this known issue for users

## Summary

‚úÖ **All data sources are perfectly synchronized:**
- Correct Final CSV files
- Regular Final CSV files  
- PostgreSQL Database (port 5432)

The database is **production-ready** and contains an accurate, complete copy of all your data.
